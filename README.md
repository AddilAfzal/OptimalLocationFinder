# Optimal Location Finder

This repository contains code for the solution developed as part of my final year dissertation. This solution was developed as a proof of concept.

## Abstract
The purpose of this project was to simplify the property searching process, by gathering meaningful data
that would otherwise be retrieved from various sources, and then representing it through one
interactive system. This would allow for the user to make an informative decision much quickly, by
limiting the number of different types of research that need to be performed independently. The data
collected had one of two purposes: to be used as filters to limit a result-set, and/or to display in relation
to a property.
